⚠️ To find who is not following you back, you will need two files directly from Instagram.<br>
If you don't have them, please go to <a href="#">how to download necessary info</a>.<br>

___
[1] First of all, open the website <a href="#">unfollowZ</a>. Appreciate that good looking design haha.<br>

___
[2] Open both files (followers | following) in your browser.<br>
Starting with followers, select everything from the page (CTRL + A) and paste it in the box followers.<br>
Don't worry about any other text like titles or dates, unfollowZ cleans everything.<br>

<br>
___
[4] Once you have both, your followers and following, click the button to find those unfollowerz.<br>
It will create a list of clickable links with your unfollowerz. In this example, I'm following shaq, but of course, he is not following me back.<br>

___
[5] Click in any of the users, it will open a new tab with that profile, so you can unfollow them manually.<br>
And that's everything! Pretty easy huh?
